The location has to cover more or less this requirements:

* Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
* 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child.
* Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
* Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.
* Account managers need to travel a lot.
* Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.
* The CEO is vegan.
* If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.

## My project 
The final location will be a city. 

- Designers (23%) and Developers (17%) compose 40% of the workforce. The company has a higher chance to recruit and retain good talent in those areas if they are located in a place that is either:
    1. near design companies <br> 
    OR
    2. near successful tech startups that have raised more tham 1M 

#### *To find the ideal city, the first decision to make is to narrowing down the research.*

- From a list of 18.8K companies, design and tech startups with a high net worth are selected. 

- Once this pre-selection is done, the cities chosen will be the top 3 cities with the highest number of companies.

#### The selected cities are `San Francisco`, `New York` and `London` üèÜ

- Using foursquare API) some establishments that meet employee requirements in the 3 cities are located. 



#### `San Francisco` was the choosen city as it contained the most number of requirements near a chosen radius
